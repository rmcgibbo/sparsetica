@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="For systems that evolve under Langevin dynamics, the operator is a backward Fokker-Planck operator.\cite {coifman2008diffusion} For a discrete-time reversible Markov chain like thermostated Hamiltonian dynamics integrated with a finite-timestep integrator, the associated operator is a backward transfer operator.\cite {schutte2001transfer}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We use the phrase `phase space' to refer to either a position, momenta phase space, or a position-only configuration space, depending on the underlying dynamics. For thermostatted Hamiltonian or Langevin dynamics, $\Omega =\protect \mathbb  {R}^{6N}$, where $N$ is the number of atoms. For overdamped Langevin dynamics, also called Brownian or Smoluchowski dynamics, $\Omega =\protect \mathbb  {R}^{3N}$. In periodic boundary conditions, the position space is some $3N$-dimensional torus, but the exact definition of $\Omega $ is not critical for our purposes."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="For example, if the underlying dynamics are overdamped Langevin on a potential energy function $U(x)$ in units of $kT$ with unit diffusion constant, simulated using an Euler-Maruyama integrator with a unit time step, the stochastic transition density kernel, $p(x, y)dy$, would be the probability density function of a Gaussian distribution with mean $\protect \mathaccentV {bar}016{y}=x-\nabla U(x)$ and variance $\sigma ^2=2$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="At this point, we switch the notation slightly for clarity of presentation. $\protect \mathbf  {x} \in \protect \mathbb  {R}^m$ will be the vector of sparse tICA expansion coefficients being optimized, and we take the $t$-dependence of $\protect \mathbf  {C}(t)$ to be implicit, so we simply use the notation $\protect \mathbf  {C}$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="To be concrete, set $a_1 = 0$, and choose $a_2$ and $a_3$ to satisfy \protect {$a_2 \delimiter "426830A \psi _2 | q \delimiter "526930B _\mu = - a_3 \delimiter "426830A \psi _3 | q \delimiter "526930B _\mu $ and $a_2^2 + a_3^2 = 1$}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="To demonstrate that $E[\psi _2] = \lambda _3^{2t}$, note that for this choice of $q$ and $f(t/\tau )$, $\protect \mathaccentV {tilde}07E{\protect \mathcal  {T}}(t)$ is equal to the sum of the first two terms in the spectral decomposition of $\protect \mathcal  {T}(t)$. The squared spectral norm of the difference between the two operators is the square of the largest eigenvalue of the difference operator. The first two eigenpairs having been subtracted out, the square of the largest remaining eigenvalue is $\lambda _3^{2t}$."}
